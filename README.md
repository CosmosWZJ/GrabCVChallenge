An attempt for Grab CV Challenge

The model is based on ResNet50, retrain the network but freeze the first 2 layer.
The validation accuracy finally reaches about 66% and start to overfit.

Model is stored as .h5 format where you can download from https://drive.google.com/open?id=1UV7tTT-mY1ULOIxScq1wnFUnVpkxIfOe my google drive.

It is a very good opportunity for me to learn new deep learning techniques.
